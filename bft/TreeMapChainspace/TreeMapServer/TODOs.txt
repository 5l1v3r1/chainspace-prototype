- In MapClient, timeout values for collecting responses for accept_t requests to all shards have been hardcoded. These need to be moved out to the configuration file.

- The incremental timeout approach used in accept_t in MapClient can be used in other places too where asynch replies are expected from multiple shards. However, accept_t is the only place where next steps depend on replies from all shards, hence a bottleneck. There's no such bottleneck where we don't really care about replies, so it's not urgent

- The code for collecting asynchronous responses from all shards is long and redundantly used in multiple functions. Move out common code to a function 

- Need a way to propagate error messages to the client. Currently I just use binary responses with error descriptions being dumped to stdout. A client should ideally receive a final response Committed/Aborted) and an explanation to help understand what went wrong.

- The data structure 'sequences' in TreeMapServer needs more thought in terms of logging as this information might help in auditing.

- Where is the blockchain?
